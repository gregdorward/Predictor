outcomes for every game\\n If a game has completed, the predictions is displayed on the right and the actual result on the left\\n Each individual fixture is tappable/clickable. By doing so, you can access a range of detailed stats, from comparative charts, granular performance measures to previous meetings.\\n All games are subject to the same automated prediction algorithm with the outcome being a score prediction. Factors that determine the tip include the following, amongst others:\\n - Goal differentials\\n - Expected goal differentials \\n - Attack/Defence performance\\n - Form trends over time\\n - Home/Away records\\n - WDL records\\n - Points per game \\n - A range of other comparative factors\\n  –\\n\";\n\n  const text2 =\n    \"A range of tools are available should you wish to use them\\n Build a multi - Use the '+' or '-' buttons to add or remove a game deemed to be one of XGTIpping's highest confidence tips from the day\\n Exotic of the day: A pre-built exotic multi comprising of XGTipping's highest confidence tips\\n BTTS games: Games where both teams to score is deemed a likely outcome\\n Over 2.5 goals tips: Games where over 2.5 goals are most likely to be scored\\n XG tips: Comprises only games where the expected goal differentials between each team are at their greatest.
