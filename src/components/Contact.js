        <p>
          Due to the digital nature of our services, all payments are final, and we do not offer refunds.

          If you believe you have been charged incorrectly, reach out to us before initiating a chargeback.

        <p>
          You may cancel your subscription anytime through your account settings. Cancellations prevent future billing, 
          but no refunds are issued for unused time. Access remains active until the end of the billing cycle.
